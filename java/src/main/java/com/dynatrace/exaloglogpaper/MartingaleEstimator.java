/**
 * A martingale estimator, that can be used in conjunction with a distinct counter such as {@link
 * HyperLogLog} or {@link UltraLogLog} to obtain slightly more accurate estimates for
 * non-distributed data streams than the corresponding standard estimators. For distributed data
 * streams, which require merging of partial results into a final result, the use of this martingale
 * estimator is not very useful and therefore not recommended.
 *
 * <p>In order to get correct estimates, this estimator must be updated with every single add
 * operation of the corresponding distinct count data structure using {@link HyperLogLog#add(long,
 * StateChangeObserver)} and {@link UltraLogLog#add(long, StateChangeObserver)}, respectively.
 *
 * <p>The estimator will become invalid, if the associated data structure is modified using
 * non-element addition operations such as {@link HyperLogLog#add(HyperLogLog)} or {@link
 * UltraLogLog#add(UltraLogLog)}. It is possible to initiate a new martingale estimator using the
 * values returned by {@code getStateChangeProbability()} and {@code getDistinctCountEstimate()} of
 * the corresponding distinct counter. At that point, the martingale estimator returns the same
 * estimate as the standard estimator. However, if many further elements are added, the martingale
 * estimator may again produce better estimates.
 *
 * <p>The estimator remains valid if the associated data structure is downsized with {@link
 * HyperLogLog#downsize(int)} or {@link UltraLogLog#downsize(int)}.
